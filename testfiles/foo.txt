DAYLIGHT. Moving over the towers of downtown Gotham... 
Closing in on an office building... On a large window... 
Which SHATTERS to reveal- 

INT. OFFICE, HIGH RISE — DAY 

A man in a CLOWN MASK holding a SMOKING SILENCED PISTOL 
ejects a shell casing. This is DOPEY. He turns to a 
second man, HAPPY, also in clown mask, who steps forward 
with a CABLE LAUNCHER, aims at a lower roof across the 
street and FIRES a cable across. Dopey secures the line to 
an I-beam line- CLAMP on- sends a KIT BAG out then steps 
OUT the window. . . 

EXT. HIGH-RISE — DAY 

...into space. The men SLIDE across the DIZZYING DROP... 
landing on the lower roof across the street. 

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM — DAY 

A MAN on the corner, back to us, holding a CLOWN MASK. An 
SUV pulls up. The man gets in, puts on his mask. Inside 
the car- two other men wearing CLOWN MASKS. 

GRUMPY 

Three of a kind . Let 1 s do this . 

One of the Clowns looks up from loading his automatic 
weapon . 


CHUCKLES 

That's it? Three guys? 

GRUMPY 

There's two on the roof. Every guy 
is an extra share. Five shares is 
plenty. 


CHUCKLES 



Six shares. Don't forget the guy 
who planned the job. 

GRUMPY 

Yeah? He thinks he can sit it out 
and still take a slice then I get 
why they call him the Joker. 

Grumpy cocks his weapon. Bozo pulls the car over in front 
of the GOTHAM PIRST NATIONAL BANK. 

EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK — CONTINUOUS 

Dopey PRIES open an access panel- 

HAPPY 

Why do they call him the Joker? 

DOPEY 

I heard he wears make-up. 

HAPPY 

Make-up?
